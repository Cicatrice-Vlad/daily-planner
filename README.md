# Daily Planner

## Description

For this project I have chosen to take into consideration the following:

- There was a need of a daily planner App that could help students and workers get through their working days in an organized manner.
- This project was meant to help with that issue, and so it did with at least one individual.
- Time-management is one of the most required soft skills nowadays by anyone that has the organisational sense of a working day. This project surely helped with that issue.
- It is understandably helpful to have an App that can help you plan your day, not needing to remind yourself about all the activities and keep track worrying about deadlines.



## Usage
